I thought I was going to have the most trouble with this assignment, but I actually ended up feeling very good about it.
Once I got the hang of the firebase I felt much better, but that part took some time.

I believe everything is working exactly as it should be. 
The class excercises obviously were a huge help leading up to this homework.
I'm not sure if I could write all of this code from scratch just yet, 
but I was able to take code from our excercises and apply them here.
The main take away here is I understood how and why the code worked.
